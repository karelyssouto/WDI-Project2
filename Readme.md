## User Stories 
1. As a User, I want to be able to create a profile in which I can put my name, email, a profile picture, and the style of how I dress so that other users can see it on the page when they click on my profile.
2. As a User, I would like to create a gallery inside my profile, in which I could include pictures of the clothing items I own.
3. As a User, I want to be able to organize my clothes in different categories.
4. As a User, I would like to add a gallery called 'outfits', in which I can add different clothing items to create different outfits.
5. As a User, I would like to add information to a specific item, such as the store it's from and the website to that store.

### Virtual Closet vs 1.1

1. User Authentication
2. Allow users to mark an item as a favorite and pushing that into a closet category.
3. Users are able to upload a local image.

### What I learned from this project

1. Start with smaller goals, and then work your way up.
2. Importance of committing.
3. When you feel like giving up, take a break and do something you enjoy to get your confidence back.

### What could have I done differently?
1. Evaluate my ERDs, taken a step back and done my routes differently.
2. Try to get my last delete.
3. Style it a little more, so that it does not look so generic.
