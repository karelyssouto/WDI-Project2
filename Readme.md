# Project 2

## User Stories 
1. As a User, I want to be able to create a profile in which I can put my name, email, a profile picture, and the style of how I dress so that other users can see it on the page when they click on my profile.
2. As a User, I would like to create a gallery inside my profile, in which I could include pictures of the clothing items I own.
3. As a User, I want to be able to organize my clothes in different categories.
4. As a User, I would like to add a gallery called 'outfits', in which I can add different clothing items to create different outfits.
5. As a User, I would like to add information to a specific item, such as the store it's from and the website to that store.
